## My process

I first drew out on paper what the boxing would need to be, then implemented.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More about using Flexbox.


### Continued development

I'm struggling with how to make the container align vertically. I had to force in a height to make it do this and I'm sure that's not the right way. Without a forced height, align-items didn't do anything.
